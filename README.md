# BelayerDemo
Showcasing our React-Native app Belayer

Belayer was built to make it easy for rock climbers to find
belay partners.

Make partner requests by specifying the type of climbing you'll be doing.

Or wait for others' partner requests at your nearby gym.

Let others check if your climbing level is a good fit for them.
